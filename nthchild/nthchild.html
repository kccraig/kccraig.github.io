    <h1>Specificity</h1>
    <p>CSS Specificity is the set of the rules applied to CSS selectors in order to determine 
        which style is applied to an element. The more specific a CSS style is, the higher point value it accrues, and the likelier
         it is to be present on the element's style</p>
  <p>In other words, specificity is being able to specifically target your CSS to a specific element or group of elements</p>
